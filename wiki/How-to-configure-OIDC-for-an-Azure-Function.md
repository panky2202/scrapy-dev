OIDC â€“ is a modern robust protocol for authentication. But it's kinda hard to configure for an Azure function:

- open [https://resources.azure.com/](https://resources.azure.com/)
- enable file auth config
  using [instruction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-authentication-how-to#enabling-file-based-configuration)
  , name your config "auth.json"
- create "auth.json", add it to repo, and fill it
  using [instruction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-openid-connect#-add-provider-information-to-your-application)
- you can find all "auth.json" structure
  description [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-authentication-how-to#configuration-file-reference)
