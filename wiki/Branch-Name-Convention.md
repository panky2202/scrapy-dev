Branch name convention:
- `spider-name` - for initial spider commit
- `spider-name/feat/feature-name` - when you need to add a new feature to a spider
- `spider-name/fix/issue-name` - when you fix a spider bug
- `spider-name/refactor` - when you want to refactor a spider

You should now understand the pattern

If feat/bug/refactor related to multiple spiders, you can use branches like:
- `feat/feature-name`
- `fix/issue-name`
