Key factor that allows to scale software production:

- automated testing
- automated deployment
- developers have freedom to make key decisions themselves
- management is focused on explaining context, and not on giving tasks

## Rules of thumb

- If you want to write something: grab an example that you like from nearby; copy it; refactor it. Generally, try to
  repeat the clean code you see around. Not all the code will be clean tho. With experience, you should start cleaning
  around mistakes you see
- Delete all unused code you see, don't push unused code/imports to git. This is extremely important for smooth
  refactoring. Imagine you have a huge feature that busses no longer uses. If you leave this feature in a repo, each
  refactoring of common library will require developers to update this useless feature, or CI/CD will fail. This drains
  resource. Unused code drains teams resources on updates during refactoring, and adds cognitive load.
- Feel stuck/confused? ask for help! The help will come, but with a huge delay tho, we are 100% remote team in different
  timezones
- Try to avoid state/value
  mutation. [An article on the subject](https://medium.com/dailyjs/the-state-of-immutability-169d2cd11310)
- Try to split your code into more functions
- Try to split your code into more variables
- Try to split your code into more modules
- Practice Test-Driven Development
- Do not change old tests without consulting with a Maintainer. They were written for a reason and define the correct
  way the system expects to behave
- More communication with other devs generally is a good thing
- Don't commit any credentials to git. Consider all git data public

## What your management wants

To make it easier to accept merge requests, you should think and write code that way, so it would be easier to review.
This means:

- All complex logic should be covered with unit tests, thus a Maintainer can just check, that tests output expected
  results, and have edge cases covered. Without the tests, Maintainer will need to debug your code, to understand, that
  it is correct
- Lots of functions and variables names. More names you add to the code - easier it is understood, what it does. Don't
  use comments tho, comments are not validated with the compiler and can become stale
