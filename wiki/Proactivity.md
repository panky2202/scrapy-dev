In modern society people/companies usually act reactive, eg, they wait for external input to guide them to act:

- In schools we get home works: someone decided what we should do, and we execute
- In universities we study fixed curriculum and get marks on how well we followed the orders
- Thus in workplaces usually we expect receive commands, this is a widespread culture: manager stays behind back and
  gives orders, dev executes orders even if don’t feel value in them

However, with software development this approach is limiting:

- This approach is good when you have repetitive well-defined tasks, eg, on assembly line you need to follow orders
  supers strictly
- With software tasks are not defined, cuz every day we do/study something new. There is no reason to make the second
  Facebook. We strive to solve not yet solved problems. In this circumstance you could not receive a well-defined task,
  cuz it doesn’t exist yet, it’s a research job. Software is a living organism, that evolves, adapts

If we want to scale to multiple parallel teams and 100 devs, we need people to act without commands/management input.
Management could not physically produce well-defined tasks on this scale.

This is why the best member of a team:

- Research, find a way of producing value/big impact for the business
- Organise himself and others to produce the value
- Teach others

This approach is extremely scalable. It will bring us freedom and power.
