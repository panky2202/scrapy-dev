# Feedback Loop

How to build a top-performing team in which you feel happy and not burned out

## The Problem: We hate honesty (but still want it)

Imagine:

- You are a boss of a company
- You came up with a new project idea, that you think will bring lots of value and money
- You like your idea, you are very excited
- In reality, however, your idea is terrible and will waste everyone's money and time
- Some of your employees know for sure that your idea is terrible
- Would you like others to tell you, that your idea is terrible? Or would you rather not know their opinion?

Most people would like to know if they are doing a mistake.

In a 2014 study, the consulting firm Zenger Folkman collected data on feedback from almost one thousand people:

> - 72% felt their performance would improve if they received more corrective feedback.
> - 92% agreed with the comment, “Negative feedback, if delivered appropriately, improves performance.”

However, in practice few people enjoy receiving criticism. We hate honesty, but still want it.

Receiving bad news about your work triggers feelings of self-doubt, frustration, and vulnerability. Your brain responds
to negative feedback with the same fight-or-flight reactions of a physical threat, releasing hormones into the
bloodstream, quickening reaction time, and heightening emotions.

And if there is one thing we hate more than receiving criticism one-on-one, it is to receive that negative feedback in
front of others.

That's why in most companies people tend not to share negative feedback, and especially to a boss. You've probably
experienced moments like these: a boss, or a colleague is telling a bad idea, and you keep silence. You may not always
remain silent. But often you do — and when you do, it's likely to be because of one of the following reasons:

- You think your viewpoint won't be supported
- You don't want to be viewed as "difficult"
- You don't want to get into an unpleasant argument
- You don't want to risk upsetting or angering your colleagues. You're wary of being called "not a team player"
- You're afraid that there will be negative consequences on your salary or promotion

You could help the team, but you are choosing not to.

Without negative feedback team's growth is limited. You need to know what you need to improve to become better. But
giving and receiving negative feedback is a tricky task due to strong negative emotions involved.

## The Solution: Negative feedback loop

### Use Experience of Top Performing Teams

Prominent software companies like GitLab or Netflix publish their inner guidelines in forms of books and documents. By
reading and implementing these guidelines we can reuse experience of top performing teams in the world. This way our
team can grow and produce lots of value and money.

Netflix especially good described their negative feedback policy in a
book [No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention](https://www.amazon.com/No-Rules-Netflix-Culture-Reinvention/dp/1984877860)
. (If you are interested in build scalable software teams I highly recommend buying an audio version of this book and
listen to it during your daily chores. You can also find a PDF of this book for free)

In Netflix all team members give each other negative feedback every day and everywhere. Negative feedback is a part of
their culture. Reed Hastings, co-founder of Netflix, named honest feedback as a foundation of a top performing team. In
2020 Netflix employed approximately 9,400 full-time workers, they know how to build big.

It's stressful and unpleasant to hear what we are doing poorly, but after the initial stress, that feedback really
helps. Most people intuitively understand that a simple feedback loop can help them get better at their jobs.

A feedback loop is one of the most effective tools for improving performance. We learn faster and accomplish more when
we make giving and receiving feedback a continuous part of how we collaborate. Feedback helps us to avoid
misunderstandings, creates a climate of co-accountability, and reduces the need for hierarchy and rules.

When considering whether to give feedback, people often feel torn between two competing issues: they don't want to hurt
the recipient's feelings, yet they want to help that person succeed. Default and less efficient feedback culture is:

- "Only give feedback when someone asks you for it"
- "Praise in public, criticize in private."

Our goal is to help each other succeed, even if that means feelings occasionally get hurt. In the right environment,
with the right approach, we can give the feedback *without* hurting feelings.

To become the best team we need to implement a feedback loop into regular collaboration.

## Negative Feedback Guidelines

It is fairly easy to give positive feedback for someone. However, the most hard, and the most useful part of feedback,
is *public negative feedback*. Public negative feedback to a boss is especially hard.

That is why there is a set of feedback rules everyone should respect and actively try to follow. There are 4A Rules of
Negative Feedback:

### Giving Feedback

### 1. AIM TO ASSIST

Giving feedback in order to get frustration off your chest, intentionally hurting the other person, or furthering your
political agenda is not tolerated. Clearly explain how a specific behavior change will help the individual or the
company, not how it will help you.

Wrong feedback:
> The way you pick your teeth in meetings with external partners is irritating for me

This statement may be 100% accurate, however it is not helpful. It is focused on personal feelings, and not on helping
the individual or the company.

Right feedback:
> If you stop picking your teeth in external partner meetings, the partners are more likely to see you as professional, and we're more likely to build a strong relationship

This is a helpful feedback. It focuses the value of the behavioral change on the recipient and on the company.

Rules of thumb:

- Never give criticism when you're still angry, wait till cool down
- Actively try give criticism that way that the other person would feel positive and motivated to change behavior. Do
  not scold and shame, this will suppress behavioral change
- Do not give criticism to intentionally hurt the other person. Usually this happens when you are under negative
  emotions yourself, wait till cool down
- Do not give criticism for personal gain, focus on helping the other person

### 2. ACTIONABLE

Your feedback must focus on what the recipient can do differently. On a concrete action or step that could be taken.

Wrong feedback:
> Your code sucks. It contains lots of bugs, and it damages our company's reputation. You should try better

This statement may be 100% accurate, however it is not helpful. "Try better" – is a super vague and not helpful advice.
If the person had known how to code with fewer bugs, them would do it already. Additional profanity/rudeness "sucks"
triggers defence mechanism in the other person, and makes them less willing to change behavior.

Right feedback:
> I have noticed that your code contains bugs in production /link1/ /link2/. If you decouple your business logic from persistence layer, you could cover the logic with unit tests, that would drastically improve your code quality, leading to fewer bugs and better architecture. Read more about this technique in this article /link/

This is a helpful feedback. It describes the issue, and gives a complete **actionable** solution. It does it with
respect and politeness – that would increase chances of behavior change.

Even if you do not know the exact answer, you can still describe the issue in details and propose an actionable
solution:
> I have noticed that your code contains bugs in production two weeks in a row /link1/ /link2/. I feel that there is a patter. Usually such bugs caused by lack of automated testing. Try to ask a senior developer to coach you best practices of automated testing.

### Receiving Negative Feedback

### 3. APPRECIATE

Natural human inclination is to provide a defense or excuse when receiving criticism; we all reflexively seek to protect
our egos and reputation. When you receive feedback, you need to fight this natural reaction and instead ask yourself,
"How can I show appreciation for this feedback by listening carefully, considering the message with an open mind, and
becoming neither defensive nor angry?"

Imagine you've received feedback like this:
> You promised but didn't come to the meeting, and we could not contact you. Broken promises damage your professional reputation, and make collaboration ineffective. Try to add things you promise into an app on your phone /link/, it can send reminders day/hour before them.

Wrong response
> My dog got hit by a car, and I needed urgently transfer her to veterinary, that's why I couldn't come to the meeting as promised.

This statement may be 100% accurate, however it is not helpful. Don't try to defend yourself and give an explanation of
your behavior, this will only cause frustration. You can't change the feedback or someone's option of you, you can only
make sure that you understand it correctly.

Right response
> Thank you for your feedback, and sharing the link to the app.

This is a helpful response. You appreciate others for spending time on writing the feedback according to the rules, and
sharing useful information. You also took time to find gratitude and made a specific observation of what was helpful in
the feedback.

Rules of thumb:

- Assume, that others follow the rules and wish good for you. We try not to work with people, that actively hurting
  others
- Never response if you are angry, or under strong emotions, wait till cool down
- Ask qualification questions if the feedback is not clear to you
- The most important: don't waste your time trying to change feedback or others persons opinion, this will only cause
  tension and frustration for everyone

### 4. ACCEPT OR DISCARD

You will receive lots of feedback from lots of people. You are required to listen and consider all feedback provided.
You are not required to follow it. Say "thank you" with sincerity. But both you and the provider must understand that
the decision to react to the feedback is entirely up to the recipient.

Rules of thumb:

- Only you decide if you want to change your behavior/follow the feedback, or discard it
- Others do not know all the context, don't know your situation and tradeoffs
- Accept or Discard the feedback internally, but don't try to explain yourself, change others person opinion or the
  feedback
- Say "Thank you" even if you are discarding feedback

### Don't Punish or Fire For Negative Feedback

If you are the boss, and you have received a negative feedback from your employee, it would be a major crime to punish
the employee for the courage. Eg, Fire/reducing salary/harming in any other way.

We try to build a culture of honesty and growth. Punishment for negative feedback will undermine all our efforts. Such
manager's behavior should not be tolerated, and such managers should be fired.

### There Is a Difference Between Being Honest, And a Jerk

There is a line between being honest and being a jerk. An honest feedback does not mean that you can speak your mind
without concern for how it will impact others. On the contrary, it requires that everyone think carefully about the 4A
Rules of Negative Feedback. This requires reflection and sometimes preparation before you give feedback, as well as
monitoring and coaching from those in charge.

### When/Where Is It Appropriate To Give Feedback?

Everywhere. But you need to follow the 4A rules. It is esiear to follow the rules with text communication. I propose
start learning the rules while typing, and then switch to verbal communication.
